Task was to predict the probability of various defects on steel plates. Submissions were evaluated using area under the ROC curve using the predicted probabilities and the ground truth targets.
To calculate the final score, AUC was calculated for each of the 7 defect categories and then averaged.

The dataset for this competition (both train and test) was generated from a deep learning model trained on the Steel Plates Faults dataset from UCI. Feature distributions are close to, but not exactly the same, as the original.
